Oleaster Runner
=====
Oleaster Runner is a JUnit Runner that allows you to write JUnit tests like you would write Jasmine tests.

````java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.OleasterRunner;
import static com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.StaticRunnerSupport.*;

@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)
public class RunnerIntroductionTest {{
	describe("A suite", () -> {
		it("contains a spec with an expectation", () -> {
			// test code
		});
	});
}}
```

## Setup
To use `OleasterRunner` you need to add `oleaster-runner.jar` to you classpath. Since `OleasterRunner` is a JUnit
Runner you also need JUnit 4 in your classpath.
If you are using Maven you just have to add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependencies>
	<dependency>
		<groupId>com.mscharhag.oleaster</groupId>
		<artifactId>oleaster-runner</artifactId>
		<version>0.1.1</version>
	</dependency>

	<!-- Oleaster requires JUnit -->
	<dependency>
		<groupId>junit</groupId>
		<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
		<version>4.11</version>
	</dependency>
</dependencies>
```
`OleasterRunner` makes heavy use of Java 8 Lambdas, so make sure you configured Java 8 for you project.
If you are using Maven you can configure Java 8 with the `maven-compiler-plugin` plugin:
```xml
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
			<artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
			<version>3.1</version>
			<configuration>
				<source>1.8</source>
				<target>1.8</target>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
```
To improve readability it is recommended to statically import `StaticRunnerSupport.*` in your test classes. This gives
you direct access to Oleaster's static `describe()`, `it()`, `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` methods:
```java
import static com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.StaticRunnerSupport.*;
```

## Specs and Suites
Specs and Suites are used to structure tests. 

A Spec is used to test the state of the code. Specs are created using the static `StaticRunnerSupport.it()` method. 
`it()` requires two method parameters: a `String` and an `Invokable` instance. The `String` is used to describe the
purpose of the test. `Invokable` is a single method interface that is typically implemented using a Java 8 lambda 
expression. It implements the actual test.
```java
import static com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.StaticRunnerSupport.it;
...
it("describes your test", () -> {
	// use assertions to check the expected result
});
```

Suites are used to describe your tests. A suite is created by using the static `StaticRunnerSupport.describe()` method.
Like `it()`, `describe()` takes a `String` and an `Invokable` parameter. The `String` describes the suite.
The `Invokable` implements the suite and (typically) contains specs.

`describe()` takes a `String` and an `Invokable` instance as parameter. The String parameter is used to describe the purpose of your tests.
`Invokable` is a single method interface that is typically implemented using a Java 8 lambda expression. It represents
the piece of code that implements the suite and (typically) contains specs.

```java
import static com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.StaticRunnerSupport.describe;
...
describe("describes your suite", () -> {
	// suite implementation
});
```

Specs and Suites are defined when an instance of the test class is created (e.g. in the constructor of test class).
```java
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.OleasterRunner;
import static com.mscharhag.oleaster.runner.StaticRunnerSupport.*;

@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)
public class MyTest {
	public MyTest() {
		describe("A suite", () -> {
			it("contains a spec with an expectation", () -> {
				// test code
			});
		});
	}
}
```
Instead of using the constructor it is also possible to use [initializer blocks](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/initial.html).
The following test does exactly the same as the test shown above (except that imports are skipped).
```java
@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)
public class MyTest {{
	describe("A suite", () -> {
		it("contains a spec with an expectation", () -> {
			// test code
		});
	});
}}
```
Here the suite is defined in an initializer block (note the double braces).

Suites are optional, so this works too:
```java
@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)
public class MyTest {{
	it("contains a spec with an expectation", () -> {
		// test code
	});
}}
```

Suites can be nested:
```java
describe("a suite", () -> {
	describe("a nested suite", () -> {
		// suite implementation
	});
});
```

## Running code before/after specs
With `beforeEach()` and `afterEach()` it is possible to run code before and after a spec is executed:
```java
describe("beforeEach/afterEach example", () -> {
	beforeEach(() -> {
		// runs before every spec in this suite
	});
	
	afterEach(() -> {
		// runs after every spec in this suite  
	});
});
```
If `beforeEach()` or `afterEach()` is used inside nested suites, `beforeEach()`/`afterEach()` blocks of the outer suite
will run first.

## Running code before/after suites
With `before()` and `after()` it is possible to run code once at first or at last within a suite respectively:
```java
describe("before/after example", () -> {
	before(() -> {
		// runs before first spec in this suite
	});

	after(() -> {
		// runs after last spec in this suite
	});
});
```
If `before()` or `after()` is used inside nested suites, `before()`/`after()` blocks of the outer suite
will run first.

## Assertions

Validating the result of a test can be done in various ways.
Oleaster Matchers provide Jasmine-like Matchers for checking expected test results. However it is also possible to use
standard JUnit assertions or additional libraries like [Hamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/JavaHamcrest).
```java
it("shows different assertion styles", () -> {
	int value = 42;
	
	// standard JUnit
	assertEquals(42, value);
	 
	// Hamcrest
	assertThat(value, equalTo(42));
	 
	// Jasmine / Oleaster
	expect(value).toEqual(42); 
});
```
Have a look at the [Oleaster Matchers](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/blob/master/oleaster-matcher/README.md)
documentation for more information.

## Examples
The following code shows an example of a more complete Oleaster test:

```java
@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)
public class AudioPlayerExampleTest {
	private AudioPlayer player;
{
	beforeEach(() -> {
		// create a new AudioPlayer instance before each test
		player = new AudioPlayer();
	});

	it("sets the initial player state to stopped", () -> {
		expect(player.getState()).toEqual(PlayerState.stopped);
	});

	it("initializes the currently played track with null", () -> {
		expect(player.getCurrentlyPlayedTrack()).toBeNull();
	});

	describe("when a track is played", () -> {
		beforeEach(() -> {
			// play a track; this is the common precondition for all specs in this suite
			player.play(new Track("Run to the hills"));
		});

		it("updates the player state to playing", () -> {
			expect(player.getState()).toEqual(PlayerState.playing);
		});

		it("updates the currently played track", () -> {
			Track expectedTrack = new Track("Run to the hills");
			expect(player.getCurrentlyPlayedTrack()).toEqual(expectedTrack);
		});
	});
}}
```
You can find the source for this example in the `oleaster-examples` module (see: [AudioPlayerExampleTest.java](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/blob/master/oleaster-examples/src/test/java/com/mscharhag/oleaster/examples/AudioPlayerExampleTest.java)).

For more examples you can have a look at Oleaster tests which are written with Oleaster.
