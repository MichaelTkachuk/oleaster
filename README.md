Oleaster
=====

Oleaster allows you to write JUnit tests like you would write [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) tests.

An Oleaster JUnit test looks like this:

```java
@RunWith(OleasterRunner.class)
public class OleasterIntroductionTest {{
	describe("A suite", () -> {
		it("contains a spec with an expectation", () -> {
			expect(40 + 2).toEqual(42);
		});
	});
}}
```

Oleaster consists out of two independent libraries:

The [Oleaster JUnit Runner](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/tree/master/oleaster-runner) gives you the option
 to write JUnit tests in the format shown above. Java 8 Lambda expressions are used to structure a test in suites
 and specifications.
 
[Oleaster-Matcher](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/tree/master/oleaster-matcher)
 provides Jasmine-like Matchers (`expect(..).toEqual(..)`) to validate test results. These Matchers can be used
 as a replacement (or extension) for standard JUnit assertions.

[Oleaster Matcher Documentation](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/blob/master/oleaster-matcher/README.md)

Oleaster tests are (mostly) written with Oleaster (see: [Oleaster JUnit Runner Tests](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/tree/master/oleaster-runner/src/test/java/com/mscharhag/oleaster/runner) and [Oleaster Matcher Tests](https://github.com/mscharhag/oleaster/tree/master/oleaster-matcher/src/test/java/com/mscharhag/oleaster/matcher/matchers)).
